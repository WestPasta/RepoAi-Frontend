# Firebase Authentication Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you set up Firebase authentication in your RepoAi React application.

## Prerequisites
- Firebase project already deployed by your friend
- Firebase configuration details (API key, project ID, etc.)

## Step 1: Get Firebase Configuration
Ask your friend for the following Firebase configuration details:
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

## Step 2: Update Firebase Configuration
1. Open `src/firebase/config.js`
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase config
3. Save the file

## Step 3: Test the Application
1. Start your development server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to `/login` to test authentication
3. Try creating a new account and signing in
4. Verify that protected routes work correctly

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Authentication Methods
- Email/Password Sign Up
- Email/Password Sign In
- User Profile Management (Display Name)
- Secure Logout

### ✅ Protected Routes
- `/main` route is now protected
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`
- Authenticated users can access protected content

### ✅ User Experience
- Loading states during authentication
- Error handling and display
- Automatic navigation after successful auth
- User information display in dashboard

### ✅ Navigation Updates
- Home page shows different buttons based on auth state
- Authenticated users see Dashboard/Logout buttons
- Unauthenticated users see Get Started button

## File Structure

├── pages/

│   └── Home.js            # Updated with auth-aware navigation
└── App.js                 # Updated with AuthProvider
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-api-key)"**
   - Check your Firebase configuration in `config.js`
   - Verify API key is correct

2. **"Firebase: Error (auth/user-not-found)"**
   - User doesn't exist, try signing up first
   - Check if email is correct

3. **"Firebase: Error (auth/wrong-password)"**
   - Password is incorrect
   - Check caps lock and spelling

4. **Protected routes not working**
   - Ensure AuthProvider wraps your app in App.js
   - Check if ProtectedRoute component is imported correctly

### Testing Authentication
1. Create a new account with email/password
2. Sign out and sign back in
3. Try accessing `/main` without authentication (should redirect to `/login`)
4. Verify user information displays correctly in dashboard

## Security Notes
- Firebase handles password hashing and security
- API keys are safe to include in client-side code (Firebase security rules protect your data)
- User sessions are managed securely by Firebase
- Protected routes prevent unauthorized access

## Next Steps
After successful setup, you can:
1. Add password reset functionality
2. Implement email verification
3. Add social authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.)
4. Create user profile management
5. Add role-based access control

## Support
If you encounter issues:
1. Check Firebase console for error logs
2. Verify your configuration matches your friend's Firebase project
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
